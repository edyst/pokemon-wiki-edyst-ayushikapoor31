                    <p>Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players. Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

                    <p>Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water and Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players. Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so choosing the Fire variation starter is often a plus.

This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.Grass is one of the weakest types statistically, with 5 defensive weaknesses and 7 types that are resistant to Grass moves.

                water-type starter Froakie. It has the ability to take on an
                appearance resembling its trainer. Pokedex says: Greninja creates
                throwing stars out of compressed water. When it spins them and
                throws them at high speed, these stars can split metal in

                &quot;Lucario is a bipedal, wolf-like Pokémon with blue, cream,
                and black fur. It is considered to be prideful and loyal to its
                trainer. Pokedex says: By catching the aura emanating from

                &quot;Mimikyu caused quite a stir for its peculiar looks and sad
                backstory when it was originally announced for Pokémon Sun and
                Moon in 2016. Mimikyu is described as a Pokémon who felt so
                lonely that it decided to wear a rag in order to look like
                Pikachu, everyone’s favorite Pokémon. Pokedex says: Its actual
                appearance is unknown. A scholar who saw what was under its rag
                was overwhelmed by terror and died from the shock.&quot;

                &quot;Charizard is an orange draconic Pokémon who has a fiery
                temper. It is the final evolution of Charmander, one of the
                starter Pokémon for the original game. Pokedex says: Charizard
                flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes
                fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never
                turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself. &quot;

  <h2>Q and A</h2>
  <h3>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</h3>
  <ol>
      <b><li><h3>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</h3></b>
          <ul>
          <li>We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.</li>
          <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
          </ul>
      </li> 
      <b><li><h3>What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</h3></b>
          <ul>
              <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.</li>
              <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>
